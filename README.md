# Modified Adafruit Feather M0 library

Here is the Eagle library that the OPEnS lab uses for the Adafruit Feather M0. Both headers are grouped up and move together-- eliminating the hassle of having to space them apart manually. If you need help installing a library in Eagle, refer to [this guide](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/blog/library-basics-install-use-sparkfun-adafruit-libraries-autodesk-eagle/). 

To access this part, go to the "Add Parts" tool in the .sch file and expand the new Adafruit library that you installed. If you have two Adafruit libraries, expand the one that has your directory as the description.

Scroll down to the "Featherwing" section and expand it. From there, you can choose the pin layout with or without the drill holes and board dimensions of the Feather.
